# Obsidian Smart Link

Automates the process of skimming through notes to see what could be linked, but might have been missed. Should make it easier to connect ideas and spot insights. Uses Obsidian Lab and Obsidian Tools.

## Setup

1. Install Obsidian Lab plugin
2. Install requirements
3. Run the dev lab server
4. Configure the Lab plugin:
   - Panel UI
   - Blocks Widget Icon
   - Additional trigger when opening file

Starting up might be finicky, might have to quit and reopen Obsidian a few times. The panel will be empty while the script runs - logs can be seen in the dev server.

## Dev

To start up the lab server:

```
m/dev.sh
```
